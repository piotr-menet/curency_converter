## Description

Welcome to the Currency Converter, my very first project where I had the opportunity to test and showcase my basic skills in HTML, JS, CSS, BEM convention, Normalize, GIT, and Markdown. Through this project, I was able to convert imaginary fiat currency and gain valuable experience in web development. I am proud of my achievements and excited to continue honing my skills as I embark on this journey. Thank you for joining me on this exciting venture!
